These libraries are for the specific sensors installed in the prototype. Currently, these are:
- temperature sensor DS18B20
- pH Atlas Scientific
- EC Atlas Scientific
- DO Atlas Scientific

Temperature Sensor DS18B20
--------------------------
OneWire
DallasTemperature Controll

Atlas Scientific
----------------
The Tentacle Shield manufacturer has very useful ready-to-use code for setting up the sensors
Also, atlas-scientific provides useful test for setting up and learn how-to read the information from the sensors
We are also using the basis of the Arduino headers and cpp for each sensors that were developed by the openAg team.

DHT11
-----
Added the 'official' DHT11 library available at https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib
More details about this library, can be found at https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/dht11-dht22-sensors-temperature-and-humidity-tutorial-using-arduino/

All Libraries
-------------
Easiest way to install the libraries is to use the Arduino IDE or manually copy the folders (e.g. openag_ds18b20) into
the user-defined Arduino libraries: $HOME/Arduino/libraries/.
